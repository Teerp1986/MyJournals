# MyJournals
This is the backend structure of an app that will be an API using EF. This app will later become a website, android and IOS application. 

This is an API that allows you to create multiple journals of different types offered (more journal types coming). Not only can you create multiple types of Journals, you will be able to download that journal into a pdf format from the web or mobile app.(coming SOON!) There is a Health journal type that can be used the record entries that you may want to share with your healthcare provider. A Dietary journal to help track your eating habits and meals. A Travel journal type that you can record you travels and cross country adventures! Of course you have a basic General entry Journal for normal Journaling. Last but not least, a good ol fashion Notebook for quick entry reminders.
